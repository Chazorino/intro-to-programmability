# Introduction to Programmability with python

Welcome to the "Introduction to Programmability with python" series. In this repository you will find th tasks related to the content we covered in the session.

This content is intended for you to follow along and try out. Programming is learned by doing so each section includes exercises with solutions for you to solve. 

> :computer: This is an exercises. They might contain sample code that you need to extend upon like this:
> 
> Modify the code so that it says hello and includes your name
> ```python3
> print("Hello")
> ```

For these exercises you will find solutions. You can view the solution by clicking on the text

## Introduction to Git
Initially you will learn Git basics, clone this repository for a local copy of the Hands-On Labs and start working with code files collaboratively.

## Introduction to Python
Python is one of the most popular programming languages of our time and the powerhouse behind most of Ciscoâ€™s API efforts. If there is a Cisco API chances are high that there will be a software development kit for that API in python. 

In part one of this training we will start from scratch and get familiar with the basic concepts of python like variables, conditionals and functions.
[Go to exercises](python_one_tasks.md)

In part two of this training we will build on the basics from the last session to explore some more advanced data structures like dictionaries and sets. We will also get acquainted with loops and some of the useful modules that come included with the python standard library. Afterwards we will learn more about the scope of variables and the structure and execution flow of a python script. [Go to exercises](python_two_tasks.md)

In addition to that we will have a look at how to deal with JSON files with python as well. [Go to exercises](python_two_json.md)

In the final part of this training we will use the knowledge acquired to build a small python project from start to finish [Go to  exercises](sessions/python_three/Readme.md) to which you can always come back to practice.

## REST API Fundamentals
REST (Representational state transfer) is the most common API framework based on HTTP(S) and an essential part of Programmability. In this session we will provide you with the technical background on REST API as well as a practical introduction on how to consume and use REST APIs with python.
